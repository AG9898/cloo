## Overview

cloo is a client-server terminal multiplexer written in Rust. A background daemon owns every
PTY, terminal grid, and piece of layout state; thin clients attach over a Unix socket, receive
damage updates, and render. Detaching kills the client, not the session.

The functional target is parity with tmux and zellij. The differentiator is the rendered
interface — borders, status bar, focus treatment, theming, motion — and an agent-workspace
workflow for many concurrent coding harnesses. The boundary below deliberately puts all visual
work client-side.

## System Topology

```
      ┌──────────────── cloo server (daemon) ─────────────┐
      │  session ──┬── tab ──┬── layout tree              │
      │            │         └── pane ── PTY ── shell     │
      │            └── tab ...                            │
      │  each pane: PTY bytes → cloo-term → grid          │
      └───────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                          │ unix socket, length-framed
              ┌───────────┴───────────┐
         client A                 client B    (both attached, same session)
      raw mode + render        raw mode + render
      ← all visual identity lives here →
```

There is no network tier, no database, and no external service. Both processes are local, and
the socket lives at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cloo/<session>.sock`.

## Component Responsibilities

The workspace is six crates. The split is load-bearing — in particular the `cloo-term`
boundary, which is what makes the emulation backend replaceable.

| Crate | Owns | Explicitly does not |
|---|---|---|
| `cloo-proto` | Wire types, framing (serde + postcard), handshake version | Know anything about PTYs or rendering |
| `cloo-term` | Thin wrapper over `alacritty_terminal` — feed bytes, read cells, resize, scrollback | Leak `alacritty_terminal` types across its public API |
| `cloo-core` | Session/tab/pane model, layout tree, keymap, profiles, pane metadata, config | Perform I/O |
| `cloo-server` | Daemon: socket, PTY reactor, damage tracking | Decide what anything looks like |
| `cloo-client` | Attach, raw mode, renderer, theming, input encoding | Hold authoritative session state |
| `cloo` | The binary; client-vs-server dispatch, CLI surface | Contain logic that belongs in a library crate |

All six crates exist in the workspace. `crates/cloo` carries the placeholder CLI; the five
libraries are scaffolded with the dependency direction wired and their contents land across
M0–M2.

Dependencies flow one way and are declared through `[workspace.dependencies]` in the root
manifest, so every member inherits the same path and version:

```
cloo → { cloo-server, cloo-client } → cloo-core → { cloo-proto, cloo-term }
                    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Never introduce a cycle or a back-edge. `cloo-proto` and `cloo-term` have no intra-workspace
dependencies at all.

`cloo-server` also depends on `cloo-term` directly, as of M0-05: the PTY reactor owns a pane's
`Emulator` and feeds it, and routing that through `cloo-core` would mean re-exporting the
emulation surface from a crate that performs no I/O. This is a shortcut down the graph, not a
back-edge — the direction is unchanged and no cycle is introduced. The `alacritty_terminal` rule
is untouched: `cloo-server` names only `cloo-term`'s own types.

### Emulation

`cloo-term::Emulator` is one terminal emulator per pane, owned by the session task. It is
synchronous and does no I/O: the PTY reactor reads bytes and calls `feed`, which is safe across
read boundaries because parser state persists between calls — a sequence or a multi-byte
character split across two reads still parses.

The surface is exactly what the crate table promises. `feed` takes bytes; `row`, `rows`, and
`row_text` read the visible grid; `resize` reflows it; `scrollback_len`, `scroll_offset`,
`scroll`, and `scroll_to_bottom` cover history. `cursor` and `is_alt_screen` report the state a
renderer needs but cannot derive from cells alone.

`Emulator::resize` moves emulation state only. The child still has to be told through
`TIOCSWINSZ` from the PTY layer, and the two together are the resize race described in
`AGENTS.md`.

The value types (`Cell`, `Color`, `CellAttrs`, `CursorState`) are `cloo-term`'s own. They mirror
the `cloo-proto` shapes without depending on them, because `cloo-term` sits at the bottom of the
dependency graph next to `cloo-proto` and depends on nothing in the workspace. `cloo-core` owns
the conversion; the `CellAttrs` bit layouts match so it stays a field copy.

### Server

Owns all PTYs, grids, scrollback, and layout state. Fans damage out to every attached client.
A client crash can never lose state, because the client holds only a cache of the visible grid.

#### PTY reactor

`cloo-server::pty` is two layers. `Pty` is the raw resource: an `openpty` pair, a child spawned
onto the slave side as a session leader with `TIOCSCTTY`, and the `libc` calls that read, write,
and `TIOCSWINSZ` it. The master descriptor is an `OwnedFd`, set non-blocking and close-on-exec,
and `Pty`'s `Drop` kills and reaps the child — restoration is by ownership, not by a shutdown
call a caller has to remember.

`PtyReactor` is the actor body above it: one Tokio task owns one reactor, which owns that pane's
`Emulator` and loops on `pump`. Readiness comes from `AsyncFd`; `pump` reads once and feeds the
result to the emulator, and it never renders or emits an update — damage coalescing belongs to
the session task above.

Two behaviors are worth knowing. A read on a Linux PTY master whose slave has closed fails with
`EIO` rather than returning zero, so that is translated into an ordinary EOF at the boundary and
callers only see genuine errors. And `PtyReactor::resize` resizes the grid *before* issuing
`TIOCSWINSZ`, so output arriving immediately after the child's `SIGWINCH` lands on a grid that is
already the right shape; if the `ioctl` then fails, the grid is ahead of the child, which is the
recoverable direction to be inconsistent in.

### Client

Holds a copy of the visible cell grid, diffs against incoming damage, and emits escape
sequences to the real terminal. **All chrome is rendered here.** The server sends pane contents
and layout geometry; the client decides how borders, status bar, and focus treatment look.

That boundary is why theming never touches session state.

### Agent pane metadata and attention

The server owns a pane's explicit metadata: user-visible name, optional task label, working
directory, and profile (`generic`, `codex`, `claude`, or a configured local profile). It also
owns the pane's attention state and its source. The client renders these values in pane chrome,
the status bar, and attention navigation; it never determines them by reading terminal cells.

Attention is deliberately provenance-aware. A bell, process exit, manual mark, or opt-in local
adapter may set a state such as `needs_input`, `ready`, or `failed`. A live PTY alone is not proof
that a harness is working, so the default for an uninstrumented child is `unknown`. Screen
scraping a Codex or Claude transcript is prohibited: it is brittle, locale/theme dependent, and
would make the rendered grid a second source of truth.

---

## Concurrency

Tokio, actor-shaped rather than shared mutable state:

- One task per PTY, reading into that pane's `cloo-term`.
- One **session task** owning all session state — the only thing that mutates grids and layout.
- One task per attached client, holding a `broadcast` receiver for damage.

Everything reaches the session task through a single `mpsc<Command>`. There is no `Mutex` on
session state. Expect bugs in PTY/resize *ordering*, not in lock discipline.

---

## Wire Protocol

Length-framed postcard over the Unix socket. Implemented in `cloo-proto`.

```
Client → Server:  Attach { protocol_version, size, term_caps, session }
                  Detach  Input(Vec<u8>)  Mouse(MouseEvent)
                  Resize(Size)  Command(Action)

Server → Client:  Hello { protocol_version, session, tabs, size }
                  Refused { reason }
                  Damage { pane, rows: Vec<RowUpdate> }
                  CursorMoved { pane, pos, shape, visible }
                  Layout(LayoutSnapshot)  Bell(pane)  Tabs(Vec<TabSummary>)
                  Detached  Exit(code)
```

### Framing

Each frame is a big-endian `u32` payload length followed by that many bytes of postcard.
Postcard is not self-delimiting over a stream, so the prefix is what tells a reader it holds a
whole message. `cloo_proto::encode` produces a complete frame; `decode` takes one off the front
of a buffer and reports how many bytes it consumed, so a reader drains and calls again.

Two guards matter on the socket path. A partial buffer returns `ProtoError::Incomplete` — read
more and retry, never an error to report. A length prefix above `MAX_FRAME_LEN` (16 MiB) is
rejected *before* anything is allocated for it; a frame that large is a desync or a hostile
peer, not a real message.

### Handshake

**The handshake is versioned from day one.** A stale client will attach to a newer server the
first time anyone rebuilds mid-session. A clean "version mismatch, reattach" beats a protocol
desync that presents as a rendering bug.

`PROTOCOL_VERSION` lives in `cloo-proto` and **must be bumped on every change to a wire type.**
`Attach` carries the client's version and `Hello` echoes the server's, so either side can catch
a mismatch before interpreting a single message. `check_version` returns
`ProtoError::VersionMismatch`, whose `Display` output is the user-facing reattach message; the
server relays it in `Refused { reason }` and closes the connection.

### Types on the wire

IDs are newtypes (`SessionId`, `TabId`, `PaneId`, `ClientId`), serialized transparently as
`u64`. Damage is carried a whole row at a time (`RowUpdate`) rather than per cell — a row is the
smallest unit worth the framing overhead and keeps the client's apply step a copy. `CellAttrs`
is a packed bitfield rather than a struct of `bool`s, because postcard spends a byte per `bool`
and this rides the render path.

`LayoutSnapshot` is the *flattened* result of a layout pass: each pane's resolved `PaneRect` in
cells. The authoritative tree of ratios stays in `cloo-core`. Ratios never cross the wire —
a client has nothing to do with them but draw the answer.

### Multi-client sizing

Two clients of different sizes render at the **minimum** of both; the larger letterboxes. This
matches tmux and is the least surprising. Per-client independent views push size out of the
session and into the client — post-v1.

### Terminal capability and outer-terminal effects

`Attach { term_caps }` reports the client terminal's baseline capabilities. The compatibility
baseline for an interactive pane includes UTF-8 and color rendering, alternate-screen handling,
cursor updates, bracketed paste, extended keyboard input, focus events, SGR mouse routing, and
resize. A client that lacks a required capability must choose a documented fallback rather than
pretend support.

Some child programs emit sequences intended for the *outer* terminal: notifications, titles,
clipboard writes, hyperlinks, or graphics. These are not raw bytes to relay around the grid.
cloo parses them into narrowly typed, versioned effects and each client applies only effects its
capabilities and local policy permit. Effects must be safe to suppress and must never alter
authoritative session state. Arbitrary OSC/DCS passthrough is forbidden because clients can differ
and because it can bypass cloo chrome, damage accounting, and terminal-state restoration.

Inline graphics are an optional enhancement, never a compatibility requirement. If a terminal or
intermediate multiplexer cannot support graphics, the pane remains usable and cloo exposes no
broken placeholder. This is specifically relevant to Codex terminal pets, which are unavailable
inside tmux and Zellij according to the upstream documentation.

## Layout

Binary tree of containers and leaves, implemented in `cloo-core::layout` as of M0-03:

```rust
enum Node {
    Leaf(PaneId),
    Split { dir: Direction, ratio: f32, first: Box<Node>, second: Box<Node> },
}
```

`ratio` is the fraction of the parent's extent given to `first` — the left child for
`Horizontal`, the top child for `Vertical` — and is always inside the open interval `(0.0, 1.0)`.

`Layout::split` replaces a leaf with a `Split` holding the old leaf as `first` and the new pane
as `second`. `Layout::close` collapses the parent split, promoting the sibling *subtree* into
the parent's slot. `Layout::set_ratio` is the whole of resize: it walks to the pane's nearest
ancestor split on the requested axis and rewrites one `f32`. Nothing stores cell counts, so
nothing else needs updating.

`Layout::resolve` is the single layout pass. It flattens the tree into one `PaneRect` per leaf,
tiling the area exactly — no gaps, no overlap, no borders, since chrome is drawn client-side.
The server issues `TIOCSWINSZ` from those rects and puts them on the wire as a `LayoutSnapshot`.

Two rules that are easy to get wrong:

- **Store ratios, not cell counts.** This is what makes layout survive a terminal resize sanely.
- **Enforce a minimum pane size** and reject splits that would violate it, or you will create
  zero-width PTYs and correspondingly confusing shell behavior. `MIN_PANE_SIZE` is 20x3 cells.
  Every rejection — unknown pane, duplicate pane, out-of-range ratio, too small, last pane —
  returns a `LayoutError` and leaves the tree byte-for-byte unchanged.

The minimum is enforced at *split* time only. A layout pass over an area that shrank below the
minimum squeezes panes toward a floor of one cell per axis rather than dropping them: a resize
must always produce a drawable answer, and the ratios are still there when the terminal grows
back.

IDs are handed out by the monotonic allocators in `cloo-core::id` and are **never reused within
a session**. A recycled `PaneId` would let a stale client message land on a pane the sender
never meant, and the wire carries no generation counter to catch it.

## External Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Required / Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `alacritty_terminal` | Terminal emulation — parser, grid, scrollback, alt screen, SGR | Required, **exact-version pinned** |
| `tokio` | Async runtime for the PTY reactor and socket | Required |
| `libc` | `openpty`, `TIOCSCTTY`, `TIOCSWINSZ`, `fcntl`, and termios | Required |
| `serde` + `postcard` | Wire serialization and framing | Required |

`serde` and `postcard` are wired up in `cloo-proto` as of M0-02. `alacritty_terminal` is pinned
at `=0.26.0` in `[workspace.dependencies]` and reaches only `cloo-term`, as of M0-04. `tokio`
(features `macros`, `net`, `rt`) and `libc` land in `cloo-server` with the PTY reactor as of
M0-05; the `net` feature is what provides `AsyncFd`, not sockets.

`wezterm-term` is the designated fallback emulation backend: more deliberately public API,
heavier dep tree. Re-evaluate at M2 if the pin hurts. See [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) —
RESOLVED-02.

## Deployment Targets

cloo is a locally installed binary. There is no hosted environment.

| Channel | Artifact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| crates.io | `cloo` | `cargo install cloo` — builds from source |
| npm | `clooterminal` | Prebuilt per-platform binaries as optional deps, esbuild/swc pattern |
| Local dev | `cargo run -p cloo` | — |

Supported platforms: `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`. Windows is out
of scope for v1.

The npm package name is `clooterminal`, not `cloo` — npm's similarity filter rejects `cloo` as
too close to existing packages. The installed command is `cloo` either way, via the `bin` field.
See [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) — RESOLVED-05.

See [`ENV_VARS.md`](ENV_VARS.md) for the runtime variable matrix.

---

## Constraints

Hard architectural rules. These are the invariants that protect the design.

- **Only `cloo-term` may import `alacritty_terminal`.** No exceptions anywhere else in the
  workspace. The pin plus this boundary is the entire mitigation for upstream API churn.
- **Pin `alacritty_terminal` to an exact version.** Upgrade deliberately, never transitively.
- **The server owns all state.** Clients cache the visible grid and nothing more.
- **All session mutation goes through the session task** via `mpsc<Command>`. Never add a
  `Mutex` to session state.
- **Chrome is client-side.** The server never decides what anything looks like.
- **Coalesce damage and cap render rate (~60fps).** Never emit one update per PTY read — this
  is architectural, designed in at M1, not a later optimization.
- **Version the wire handshake** on every protocol change.
- **Every visual choice must survive a plain 16-color TTY.** Detect capability, degrade
  deliberately, never let the fallback look accidental.
- **Harness status is explicit.** Store a state and its source; never infer it by screen-scraping
  terminal output.
- **Outer-terminal effects are capability-gated and allowlisted.** Never relay arbitrary OSC/DCS
  bytes around the renderer or directly to a client terminal.
